  # Override traefik config to build custom image
  # The custom image has SSL certs and traefik config
  # baked in.
  # Disable mounts from main docker-compose, as these
  # are difficult to predict since the docker-comopose
  # is being spun up in dind and the underlying source code
  # is held on a docker volume, making it hard to mount
  # the directories to a path inside traefik
